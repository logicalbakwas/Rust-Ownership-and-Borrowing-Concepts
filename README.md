# Rust Ownership and Borrowing Exercises

I've created a set of exercises for you to practice Rust's ownership and borrowing concepts. Each exercise focuses on a different aspect of these concepts. Here's a brief explanation of what each exercise is meant to teach:

## Exercises

### Basic Ownership

This exercise demonstrates how ownership is transferred when passing a variable to a function.

### Borrowing

Here, you'll practice borrowing a value without taking ownership.

### Mutable Borrowing

This exercise shows how to mutably borrow a value to modify it.

### Multiple Borrows

This demonstrates how you can have multiple immutable borrows or one mutable borrow at a time.

### Ownership and Functions

This exercise shows how functions can take ownership and return values.

## Instructions

To practice, try implementing these exercises one by one. After each implementation, compile your code and see if it works as expected. If you encounter any errors, try to understand why they occur and how to fix them.
